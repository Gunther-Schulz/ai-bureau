# Glossary

Canonical source for term definitions across the pbs-bureau corpus. Per `MAINTENANCE.md` cascade discipline, all docs cite GLOSSARY for term meaning rather than redefining.

## How entries are structured

Each entry is tagged on 4 axes (per `MAINTENANCE.md` "TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE" section):

- **Class**: PRIMITIVE (atomic) / META-PRIMITIVE (container) / DERIVED (composition) / SCOPE-CLASSIFICATION
- **Layer**: framework-mechanism / shape-policy / cross-cutting / multi-aspect / framework-meta
- **Axis**: axis-1 / axis-2 / axis-3 / cross-axis (where applicable)
- **VISION usage**: directly used / implicit / derived-from-VISION-terms / framework-meta

Tags are a means, not an end. If an entry is clearer with fewer tags, drop the extras.

**On entry-by-entry locking (cascade prevention of inherited-framing bias)**: GLOSSARY is built foundation-up. Earlier entries may forward-reference terms not yet locked; later entries reference earlier ones. Discipline:

1. **Greenfield-draft** new entries from VISION + `MAINTENANCE.md` (locked architectural commitments) + first principles — NOT from prior entries' cross-references to this term as anchors
2. **Minimize embedded descriptions** of not-yet-locked terms — use brief role tags + cross-ref to authoritative source (`MAINTENANCE.md` or forthcoming entry); don't carry the not-yet-locked term's "definition" inline in current entry
3. **Cascade-pass after locking** per `MAINTENANCE.md` cascade discipline — review all prior cross-references to the new term; reconcile inconsistencies in the same commit

This prevents earlier-drafted cross-refs from biasing later canonical definitions.

**The three axes** referenced in tags map to VISION axes:
- **axis-1** = intertwining (workflow embedding)
- **axis-2** = sparring (interaction mode)
- **axis-3** = authorship preservation (outcome orientation)

Each axis has its own glossary entry below; full claims live in `VISION.md`.

Entries are alphabetical (case-insensitive). Cross-references are explicit; reading any entry should make the term's place in the architecture immediately clear.

## authorship preservation (axis 3)

- **Class**: DERIVED (claim/mode defined in VISION)
- **Layer**: cross-cutting
- **Axis**: axis-3
- **VISION usage**: directly used (`VISION.md` axis 3 — third interlocking principle)

**Canonical**: The architectural commitment that the practitioner remains the defensible expert author of everything PBS produces on their behalf — capable of defending, signing, and standing behind the produced work; per VISION axis 3.

**What it is**: The third VISION axis. PBS is an output-producing tool for an expert practitioner; the produced work goes out under the practitioner's name; the practitioner is legally and professionally accountable. Authorship preservation protects this professional/legal standing — no rubber-stamping, no signature without engagement, no work the practitioner can't defend. The operational test for this axis is `defensibility`.

**What it is NOT**:
- Not "user understanding" in the abstract (it's about *defending under regulatory or professional challenge*)
- Not capacity-building (capacity-building is a side effect when it happens; authorship preservation is the actual purpose)
- Not generic "human-in-the-loop" (humans-in-loop without engagement still rubber-stamp)
- Not output quality (quality is necessary but insufficient — the practitioner must be able to DEFEND it)

**Cross-archetype illustration**: legal practice signing briefs; medical practice signing case notes; planning bureau signing Begründungen; auditor signing audit reports — same axis applies wherever the practitioner-author bears regulatory/professional accountability.

**Boundary test**: ask "will the practitioner be able to defend this output six months from now under regulatory or professional challenge, having forgotten the details?" If no, axis 3 fails.

**Composes with**:
- `defensibility` — operational test for this axis (canonical entry forthcoming)
- `authorship mechanisms` — class of axis-3 mechanisms (canonical entry forthcoming)
- `practitioner` — the role this axis protects (canonical entry forthcoming)
- `practitioner-shape` — workspace shape where this axis is mandated (canonical entry forthcoming; see `shape` named-shapes catalog)

**Source**: VISION axis 3 (third principle of the thesis); "Authorship preservation, not rubber-stamping" section; the defensibility test.

**See**:
- VISION's "Authorship preservation, not rubber-stamping (axis 3)" section for full claim
- ARCH Layer 3 axis-3-mechanism topic (placeholder until Phase 3)

## framework

- **Class**: META-PRIMITIVE (container; the bounded category that contains mechanisms, protocols, and architectural disciplines)
- **Layer**: framework-meta (this entry describes the framework layer itself)
- **Axis**: cross-axis (the framework supports all three VISION axes; specific support per axis lives in mechanisms)
- **VISION usage**: directly used (`VISION.md` lines 17, 21, 72)

**Canonical**: The shape-neutral universal layer of the pbs-bureau architecture — the bounded set of mechanisms (atomic interface contracts), architectural protocols (pluggable subsystems), and architectural disciplines that any workspace shape can compose with.

**What it is**: The "what's POSSIBLE" boundary. The framework defines the universe of capabilities, contracts, and rules available to any workspace. The framework/shape architectural relationship — what's POSSIBLE (framework) vs what's MANDATED (shape) — is locked in `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE. The framework is the open-source, marketed product's foundation; PBS-Schulz is one practitioner-shape deployment built from the framework.

The framework includes:
- **mechanisms** (audit emission, source-grounding, sparring Protocol surface, etc.)
- **architectural protocols** (Coordination, Audit, Sparring, Trust, Time as pluggable subsystems with multiple implementations)
- **architectural disciplines** (cascade discipline, no-defer principle, preliminary-lock principle, make-wrong-shapes-impossible, AI-as-runtime hybrid-shape, pattern-vs-instance, glue-not-replacement)

**What it is NOT**:
- Not a specific shape's configuration (shape is the policy layer OVER the framework)
- Not the substrate (substrate is one mechanism within the framework's scope; framework is the layer that contains substrates among other mechanisms)
- Not the codebase per se (framework is the architectural layer; the codebase is one realization of the framework's mechanisms)
- Not a workspace or deployment instance (workspaces are BUILT FROM framework + shape policies + practitioners + state)
- Not market positioning or strategic claims (framework is shape-neutral; positioning lives in `STRATEGY.md`)

**Cross-archetype illustration**: All workspace archetypes share the SAME framework; they differ in which shape's policies they apply over framework mechanisms. Example shapes: practitioner-shape (PBS marketed positioning), autonomous-business-shape, personal-OS-shape, knowledge-graph-shape, federation-shape, hybrid-shape. Per-shape policy specifics live in canonical shape entries forthcoming (see `shape` entry for the meta-primitive). Same framework underwrites all archetypes; shape policies determine what each one mandates.

**Boundary test**: Two questions:
1. "Is this thing shape-specific (only valid for one shape)?" If yes → not framework; it's shape-policy or shape-specific primitive.
2. "Is this thing an interface contract any shape could use?" If yes → framework-mechanism (lives within the framework).

If a candidate concept fails test 1 (it IS shape-specific), it doesn't belong in the framework. Move to shape-extension.

**Composes with**:
- `mechanism` — atomic units of the framework (atom-vs-container relationship per `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE)
- `protocol` (architectural) — pluggable subsystems within the framework (canonical entry forthcoming)
- `shape` — counterpart in the framework/shape architectural relationship (canonical entry forthcoming; relationship locked in `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE)
- `workspace` — deployment-instance container that integrates framework + shape + specialists + practitioners

**Source**: VISION (`VISION.md`):
- Line 17: "The framework underneath is workspace-shape-neutral. Framework primitives support multiple workspace shapes via shape-extension pattern"
- Line 21: "The framework breadth (which shapes the framework supports + how the framework structurally encodes value claims) is ARCH territory"
- Line 72: "PBS does NOT claim the framework is restricted to practitioner shape — framework is shape-neutral; positioning is practitioner-focused"

**See**:
- `MAINTENANCE.md` "TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE — Framework = mechanisms; Shape = policies" section (the foundational architectural commitment)
- ARCH Layer 2 overview + Layer 3 framework-detail topics (placeholder until Phase 3)
- Other foundational meta-primitives: `shape`, `mechanism`, `policy`

## Framework C scope

- **Class**: SCOPE-CLASSIFICATION
- **Layer**: framework-meta (placement category for framework primitive definitions)
- **Axis**: cross-axis
- **VISION usage**: implicit (ARCH territory; VISION doesn't directly use this term)

**Canonical**: The scope category for framework primitive DEFINITIONS — universal, immutable, distributable; the placement home for entity-md instances that define mechanisms, shapes, substrates, protocol-implementations, and specialist DEFINITIONS. Derived from `framework = mechanisms` (mechanism definitions live here) plus the framework's other distributable elements.

**What it is**: One of three scope classifications (Framework C / Owner B / Layer A) governing where entity-md instances live. Framework C is the "definitions" home — distributable, marketplace-listable (per ROADMAP v3), immutable at definition level. Identity is by `framework_kind` + `framework_key` in entity-md frontmatter.

**Members**:
- mechanism definitions (atomic interface contracts authored at framework level)
- shape definitions (policy bundles for an archetype)
- substrate definitions (runtime contracts: Claude Agent SDK, MS AF, future)
- protocol-implementation definitions (concrete impls: always-on-sparring, claim-level-audit, etc.)
- specialist DEFINITIONS (bipartite multi-aspect primitive: DEFINITION here, INSTANCE-CONTENT in Owner B)

**What it is NOT**:
- Not for instances (those go to Owner B)
- Not for layered content varying by domain/state (that's Layer A)
- Not for runtime state

**Boundary test**: ask "is this a distributable definition that any workspace shape could potentially use?" If yes → Framework C. "Is this an instance bound to a deployment?" → Owner B. "Is this content varying by domain/state?" → Layer A.

**Composes with**:
- `framework` — Framework C IS where framework primitive definitions live
- `shape` — shape definitions live in Framework C
- `mechanism`, `substrate`, `protocol`, `specialist` (DEFINITION) — all live in Framework C
- `Owner B scope` — where INSTANCES of Framework C definitions get deployed

**Source**: derived from session-15 entity-md scope model restructure; refined session 16 under `framework = mechanisms` / `shape = policies` framing.

**See**:
- `MAINTENANCE.md` "TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE" section "A-B-C scope model"
- ARCH Layer 3 entity-md spec (placeholder until Phase 3)

## intertwining (axis 1)

- **Class**: DERIVED (claim/mode defined in VISION)
- **Layer**: cross-cutting
- **Axis**: axis-1
- **VISION usage**: directly used (`VISION.md` axis 1 — first interlocking principle)

**Canonical**: The integration depth where AI is a continuous co-worker IN the workflow itself, not a discrete feature bolted onto an unchanged workflow; per VISION axis 1.

**What it is**: The first VISION axis. AI participates in real work output — drafts, retrieves, decides, acts as orchestrating colleague — rather than offering convenience features (summarize this; format that) on the side. Requires architectural support: persistent state, orchestration, source-grounding, audit trail, continuous awareness, and explicit human-authority gates.

**What it is NOT**:
- Not "more AI" or "better AI" (it's a different SHAPE of integration, not a different magnitude)
- Not "AI agents" generically (most "AI agent" demos are still tacked-on)
- Not requiring AI to do the bulk of the work (could be 20% mechanical labor; the integration depth matters, not the labor share)
- Not generic "automation" (automation can be tacked-on too)

**Cross-archetype illustration**: planning bureau co-drafting Begründungen with AI in real workflow; legal practice with AI as co-worker on briefs; research lab with AI as co-author on manuscripts; auditor with AI as co-worker on audit findings — all instances of axis 1's deep integration.

**Boundary test**: ask "is the AI a participating colleague in actual work production, or a discrete convenience feature on the side?" If feature-on-the-side → tacked-on AI (failure mode for axis 1).

**Composes with**:
- `tacked-on AI` — the failure mode contrasted (canonical entry forthcoming)
- `intertwined AI` — positive mode (canonical entry forthcoming)
- `co-worker` — relational claim about AI's mode of participation (canonical entry forthcoming)
- `trust mechanisms` — class of axis-1 mechanisms (canonical entry forthcoming)
- `workflow` — what intertwining intertwines WITH (canonical entry forthcoming)
- `category collapse` — risk to axis 1 (canonical entry forthcoming)

**Source**: VISION axis 1 (first principle of the thesis); contrast table (tacked-on vs intertwined).

**See**:
- VISION "The thesis" axis 1 + tacked-on/intertwined contrast table
- VISION "Implications" → "Workflow as precondition" + "Category-collapse risk"
- ARCH Layer 3 axis-1-mechanism topic (placeholder until Phase 3)

---

## Layer A scope

- **Class**: SCOPE-CLASSIFICATION
- **Layer**: cross-cutting (orthogonal to mechanism/policy split)
- **Axis**: cross-axis
- **VISION usage**: implicit (ARCH territory)

**Canonical**: The scope category for LAYERED CONTENT — content varying by deployment context (universal / domain-keyed / state-keyed). **Orthogonal axis** to framework/shape framing (about content scoping, not mechanism vs policy).

**What it is**: One of three scope classifications. Layer A is **independent** of the framework=mechanisms / shape=policies framing — it's an axis for content layering by domain/state context. Identity is by `layer_scope` + `layer_key` in entity-md frontmatter. Effective content for a workspace = universal + active-domains + active-states (workspace declares which apply via its scope configuration).

**Members**:
- references (e.g., legal texts; vary by jurisdiction)
- doctypes (e.g., B-Plan-Begründung is domain-specific)
- bausteine (saved text patterns; can be domain or state specific)
- memory prose (style-spec, korrektur-rules, verfahren docs; could be domain-specific)
- conventions (writing conventions per language / jurisdiction)
- domain-specific knowledge artifacts

**Layer values**:
- `universal` — applies to every deployment regardless of domain or jurisdiction
- `domain` — applies to deployments in specific domains (e.g., PV-FFA, Wind, Naturschutz, Innenentwicklung); multiple domains can be active simultaneously
- `state` — applies to deployments in specific jurisdictions (e.g., DE-BB, DE-BY, DE-BW, ...); multiple states can be active simultaneously

**What it is NOT**:
- Not derived from framework/shape (it's an INDEPENDENT classification axis)
- Not the same as framework's universal-vs-shape-specific distinction (Layer A is about CONTENT applicability by deployment context, not about mechanism vs policy)
- Not for definitions (those are Framework C)
- Not for instances (those are Owner B)

**Boundary test**: ask "does this content vary by deployment context (domain / state / universal)?" If yes → Layer A. "Is this a definition?" → Framework C. "Is this an instance bound to deployment?" → Owner B.

**Composes with**:
- `workspace` — workspace's scope configuration (active domains, active states) determines which Layer A content applies
- references / doctypes / bausteine / prose conventions — content kinds that live at Layer A

**Source**: predates session-16 rebuild (3-axis scope orthogonality from earlier ARCH); refined session 16 to clarify orthogonal-to-framework/shape status.

**See**:
- `MAINTENANCE.md` "TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE" section "A-B-C scope model"
- ARCH Layer 3 entity-md spec (placeholder until Phase 3)

## mechanism

- **Class**: PRIMITIVE (atomic; irreducible unit of the framework)
- **Layer**: framework-mechanism (this entry describes the atomic unit at the framework layer)
- **Axis**: cross-axis (mechanisms can serve any of the three VISION axes)
- **VISION usage**: implicit (VISION uses "mechanisms" in plural for trust/sparring/authorship mechanism classes; doesn't define "mechanism" as singular term — that's `MAINTENANCE.md` territory)

**Canonical**: An atomic interface contract within the framework — a single capability with defined input/output surface, available to any workspace shape; the smallest unit of "what's POSSIBLE" the framework provides.

**What it is**: The atomic unit of the framework. Mechanisms are universal — usable by any shape, no shape-specific values embedded. They define WHAT'S POSSIBLE; shape policies determine WHAT'S MANDATED out of those possibilities. Multiple mechanisms compose into the framework alongside protocols (pluggable subsystems) and architectural disciplines (rules), per `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE.

**Examples** (per `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE concept-by-concept table):
- `AuditEvent` schema (Pydantic model contract for audit emission)
- `actor_kind` enum (declared on every audit event; framework-level guarantee)
- Pydantic gate (validator function dispatched on every contract-bearing write)
- Specialist conformity manifest schema (declaring a specialist's conformity surface as a Pydantic schema)
- Sparring Protocol surface (the architectural-protocol's interface contract, before any specific implementation)
- Source-grounding capability (every claim traceable to source; framework-level enforcement)
- Visible reasoning capability (Pydantic field on outputs requiring reasoning chain)

**What it is NOT**:
- Not a `policy` — policies are atomic CONFIGURED VALUES (defaults, requirements, constraints) within a shape's bundle; mechanisms are atomic INTERFACE CONTRACTS in the framework
- Not a `protocol` (architectural; canonical entry forthcoming) — a protocol's surface IS a mechanism, but the protocol-with-multiple-implementations structure adds composition beyond a single mechanism
- Not the `framework` itself — the framework is the CONTAINER of mechanisms (+ protocols + disciplines); a single mechanism is one element of the container
- Not a workspace-level or instance-level construct — mechanisms live at framework level with no shape-specific values
- Not an architectural discipline — disciplines are RULES about how to design (canonical homes: `MAINTENANCE.md` + `DISCIPLINES.md`); mechanisms are CAPABILITIES the framework provides

**Cross-archetype illustration**: All workspace shapes use the SAME mechanisms (e.g., the `AuditEvent` schema is the same Pydantic contract in practitioner-shape, autonomous-business-shape, etc.). What differs across shapes is which mechanisms are MANDATORY, the granularity at which they're invoked, and what defaults apply — these are policies (shape-level), not mechanism variations.

**Boundary test**: Three questions:
1. Is this an atomic capability with a defined input/output surface? → likely a mechanism
2. Is this shape-neutral (any shape could use it)? → likely a mechanism (lives in framework)
3. Is this a configured value (default, requirement, mandatory)? → it's a `policy`, not a mechanism

If a candidate fails test 2 (it IS shape-specific), it doesn't belong as a framework mechanism. Move to shape-extension.

**Composes with**:
- `framework` — contains mechanisms as its atomic interface contracts (atom-vs-container relationship per `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE)
- `policy` — counterpart atom in the framework=mechanisms / shape=policies framing
- `shape` — applies policies OVER mechanisms (which active / mandatory / defaults; per `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE)
- `protocol` (architectural) — pluggable subsystem within the framework (canonical entry forthcoming; relationship per `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE)

**Source**:
- `MAINTENANCE.md` "TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE — Framework = mechanisms; Shape = policies" section: "mechanism is the atom — a single interface contract; capability with defined input/output surface"
- `MAINTENANCE.md` "Concept-by-concept (worked examples)" table: examples per axis (audit emission, specialist modification, authority binding, sparring)

- Other foundational meta-primitives + atoms: `framework`, `shape`, `policy`

---

## Owner B scope

- **Class**: SCOPE-CLASSIFICATION
- **Layer**: cross-cutting
- **Axis**: cross-axis
- **VISION usage**: implicit (ARCH territory)

**Canonical**: The scope category for INSTANCES — deployment-specific entities owned at the workspace, specialist-instance, or work-unit-instance level; the placement home for entity-md instances that materialize in a particular deployment. Derived from `framework + shape → workspace deployment`.

**What it is**: One of three scope classifications. Owner B is the "instances" home — where definitions (Framework C) get DEPLOYED and bound to workspace context. Identity is by `owner_scope` + `owner_key` in entity-md frontmatter.

**Members**:
- workspace itself (workspace.md selecting shape + substrate + active specialists)
- workspace-scope managed entities:
  - practitioner-record (system representation; canonical `practitioner` entry forthcoming; dual-aspect: human cross-cutting, record at Owner B)
  - Actor (event emitter; canonical entry forthcoming)
  - Client (engagement target; canonical entry forthcoming)
  - additional managed entities per workspace's needs
- specialist instance content (entities owned within an active specialist instance — distinct from specialist DEFINITION which is Framework C)
- work-unit instances (kind specialist-defined: `project` for planning bureau; `matter` for legal practice; `case` for medical practice; `engagement` for consulting; `manuscript` for research; `audit` for accounting)

**What it is NOT**:
- Not for definitions (those are Framework C)
- Not for layered content (that's Layer A)
- Not where the practitioner-as-human "lives" (the human is cross-cutting; only the practitioner-record is placed)

**Boundary test**: ask "is this a deployment-specific instance bound to a workspace, specialist instance, or work-unit?" If yes → Owner B. "Is this a distributable definition?" → Framework C. "Is this content varying by deployment context (domain/state)?" → Layer A.

**Composes with**:
- `workspace` — the central Owner B instance + container for workspace-scope managed entities
- `specialist` — instance content sits at Owner B (distinct from specialist DEFINITION at Framework C)
- `work-unit` (kind specialist-defined) — instances at Owner B
- `practitioner` — record at Owner B; human itself cross-cutting
- `Framework C scope` — where the DEFINITIONS that get instantiated live

**Source**: derived from session-15 entity-md scope model restructure; refined session 16 (practitioner-record added per practitioner dual-aspect; orthogonal-Layer-A clarified).

**See**:
- `MAINTENANCE.md` "TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE" section "A-B-C scope model"
- ARCH Layer 3 entity-md spec (placeholder until Phase 3)

---

## policy

- **Class**: PRIMITIVE (atomic; irreducible unit of a shape's bundle)
- **Layer**: shape-policy (this entry describes the atomic unit at the shape layer)
- **Axis**: cross-axis (policies can configure any axis-related mechanism)
- **VISION usage**: implicit (VISION doesn't use "policy" as a defined term; the framework=mechanisms / shape=policies framing is locked in `MAINTENANCE.md`, not VISION)

**Canonical**: An atomic configured value within a shape — a single requirement, default, or constraint configuring how a framework mechanism is used for that shape's archetype; the smallest unit of "what's MANDATED" a shape declares.

**What it is**: The atomic unit of a shape's policy bundle. Policies are shape-level — they configure framework mechanisms for a specific archetype, with shape-specific values. They define WHAT'S MANDATED (out of what the framework's mechanisms make POSSIBLE). Multiple policies compose into a shape's bundle; the shape is the container.

**Examples** (per `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE concept-by-concept table; practitioner-shape policies):
- Audit granularity = claim-level (configures the framework's audit-emission mechanism)
- Sparring always-on as runtime pillar (configures the sparring mechanism)
- Human authority required somewhere in accountability-bearing output chain (configures authority-binding mechanism)
- Modifications require explicit re-conformance event (configures specialist-modification mechanism)
(Per other shapes, different policies configure the same mechanisms differently — see cross-archetype illustration below.)

**What it is NOT**:
- Not a `mechanism` — mechanisms are atomic INTERFACE CONTRACTS in the framework; policies are atomic CONFIGURED VALUES in a shape
- Not a `shape` — shape is the BUNDLE of policies (container); a single policy is one element
- Not a workspace-instance configuration — policies live at SHAPE level (in a shape definition's bundle); workspace deployments inherit them from the selected shape
- Not the framework — framework provides the mechanisms; policies live in shapes that layer over the framework

**Cross-archetype illustration** (same mechanism, different policies per shape): the framework provides the audit-emission MECHANISM (AuditEvent schema + `actor_kind` enum). Different shapes declare different POLICIES configuring it:
- Practitioner-shape policy: audit granularity = claim-level; emission required for every output
- Autonomous-business-shape policy: audit granularity = action-level; emission per task
- Personal-OS-shape policy: audit granularity = light; emission optional

Same mechanism (the framework's audit-emission contract); different policies (each shape's archetype-specific values).

**Boundary test**: Three questions:
1. Is this a configured value (a default, requirement, or constraint)? → likely a policy
2. Is this shape-specific (varies by archetype)? → likely a policy (lives in a shape's bundle)
3. Is this an interface contract any shape could use? → it's a `mechanism`, not a policy

If a candidate fails test 2 (it's universal across shapes; no archetype variation), it's not a policy — it's mechanism territory.

**Composes with**:
- `shape` — contains policies as its atomic bundle elements (atom-vs-container relationship per `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE)
- `mechanism` — counterpart atom in the framework=mechanisms / shape=policies framing (mechanism = framework atom; policy = shape atom)
- `framework` — contains mechanisms over which policies are LAYERED (per `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE)
- `workspace` — selects a shape and inherits its policies

**Source**:
- `MAINTENANCE.md` "TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE — Framework = mechanisms; Shape = policies" section: "policy is the atom — a single configured value; requirement/default/constraint"
- `MAINTENANCE.md` "Concept-by-concept (worked examples)" table: practitioner-shape column = examples of policies per axis

**See**:
- `MAINTENANCE.md` "TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE" section (atom-vs-container relationship + concept-by-concept worked examples)
- Other foundational meta-primitives + atoms: `mechanism`, `framework`, `shape`

## shape

- **Class**: META-PRIMITIVE (container; the category of policy bundles, not a single policy itself)
- **Layer**: framework-meta (this entry describes the shape layer concept itself)
- **Axis**: cross-axis (shapes can have policies serving any axis)
- **VISION usage**: directly used (`VISION.md` lines 11, 17, 19, 21, 72)

**Canonical**: A workspace archetype — a bundle of policies layered over framework mechanisms, configuring what's MANDATED for that archetype. Shape definitions are themselves framework primitives (live in Framework C scope); a workspace selects exactly one shape via its `workspace.md`.

**What it is**: A shape provides the "what's MANDATED" layer for a workspace archetype, per the framework/shape architectural relationship locked in `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE. Each shape declares its policies + may add shape-specific primitives needed for its archetype. PBS as marketed product positions on practitioner-shape; the framework underneath is shape-neutral and supports multiple shapes.

**What it is NOT**:
- Not a workspace (a workspace IS DEPLOYED as a specific shape's archetype; the shape is the configuration definition)
- Not the framework (shape sits OVER framework per `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE; framework is the universal mechanism layer)
- Not a deployment instance (shape DEFINITIONS are universal/distributable; live in Framework C scope; per-deployment selection happens via `workspace.md`)
- Not a single policy (shape is a BUNDLE)
- Not always practitioner-shape (PBS markets practitioner-shape; framework supports multiple shapes — see named-shapes catalog below)

**Cross-archetype catalog (named shapes — canonical per-shape detail forthcoming)**:
- **practitioner-shape** — workspace shape for accountability-bearing expert work; PBS marketed positioning + pioneer reference
- **autonomous-business-shape** — operator-supervised multi-agent shop
- **personal-OS-shape** — individual life-OS
- **knowledge-graph-shape** — corpus + curation; no workflow loop
- **federation-shape** — cross-node specialist sharing
- **hybrid-shape** — combinations of above

**Boundary test**: Three questions:
1. Is this an atomic unit contained within a shape (one element of its bundle)? → it's a `policy`
2. Is this an interface contract any shape could use? → it's a `mechanism` (lives in framework, not shape)
3. Is this a bundle of policies for a workspace archetype? → it's a shape

**Composes with**:
- `framework` — counterpart in the framework/shape architectural relationship (per `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE)
- `policy` — atomic unit contained within a shape's bundle
- `workspace` — deploys exactly one shape via `workspace.md`
- `Framework C scope` — where shape DEFINITIONS live as distributable framework primitives
- `mechanism` — what shape policies configure (which active / mandatory / defaults; per `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE)

  - Line 11: "any practitioner workspace shape (legal practice, research lab, creative studio, etc.)"
  - Line 17: "Framework primitives support multiple workspace shapes via shape-extension pattern"

## skill

- **Class**: PRIMITIVE (atomic; the work-logic unit) — single-aspect (no multi-scope manifestation)
- **Layer**: cross-cutting (skill is an application-level work-logic unit that lives within specialists; manifests at whatever scope the containing specialist manifests at)
- **Axis**: cross-axis (skills serve any axis depending on what work they encode)
- **VISION usage**: implicit (VISION line 7 says "codified expertise bundled as specialists"; skills are the atomic units of that expertise; not directly defined as glossary term in VISION)

**Canonical**: An atomic unit of work logic within a specialist — an auto-loaded behavioral protocol that fires when its trigger conditions match. Skills are the smallest composable unit of codified expertise; specialists bundle multiple skills (+ entities + memory + adapters) into a distributable expertise package.

**What it is**: A skill is what you'd reach for when you want to express "do this specific kind of work when this condition is met." Skills have triggers (when they fire), body content (what they instruct), and may declare output schemas (Pydantic models for structured output). Multiple skills compose into a specialist; the specialist is the cohesion abstraction; the skill is the atomic unit.

**What it is NOT**:
- Not a `specialist` — specialist is the bundle; skills are units within it
- Not a `workspace` — workspace activates specialists (which contain skills); workspace doesn't activate skills directly
- Not a `mechanism` — skills are application-level work logic, not framework-level interface contracts
- Not a sparring sub-mechanism — those are specific axis-2 capabilities (counter-argument, confidence calibration, etc.); skills are general-purpose work units that may USE sparring mechanisms
- Not a `workflow` (canonical entry forthcoming) — workflow is the broader pattern of work; skills are atomic actions within workflows

**Cross-archetype illustration** (named examples; archived plugin/skills/ catalog):
- **orchestrator** — coordinates session-open + decision routing + state management (PBS-Schulz)
- **save-baustein** — saves reusable text patterns to memory (PBS-Schulz; cross-archetype)
- **draft-textteil-b** — drafts B-Plan-Begründung text (planning-domain; PBS-Schulz)
- **validate-checklist** — validates work against doctype checklists (cross-archetype)
- **citation-verification** — checks legal/scholarly citations (cross-archetype)
- **review-draft** — runs layered review with sparring mechanisms (cross-archetype)

A specialist activates a coherent set of skills; e.g., `planning-document-work` specialist bundles `orchestrator + save-baustein + draft-textteil-b + review-draft + validate-checklist + research-references + verify-citations + ...`.

**Boundary test**: Three questions:
1. Is this an atomic unit of work logic that fires on a trigger? → it's a skill
2. Is this codified expertise BUNDLED as a distributable unit? → it's a `specialist` (containing skills)
3. Is this a framework-level interface contract? → it's a `mechanism`, not a skill

**Composes with**:
- `specialist` — specialist contains skills as its atomic work-logic units; skill cannot be used outside specialist context (a specialist provides the skill's runtime context, dependencies, references)
- `mechanism` — skills use framework mechanisms (audit emission, source-grounding, sparring) at runtime via the substrate
- `workflow` (canonical entry forthcoming) — skills participate in broader workflows (sequence of skill firings + decisions)
- `actor` (canonical entry forthcoming) — skills emit AuditEvents with `actor_kind: skill` per archived audit-trail v2 schema

## sparring (axis 2)

- **Class**: DERIVED (claim/mode defined in VISION)
- **Layer**: cross-cutting
- **Axis**: axis-2
- **VISION usage**: directly used (`VISION.md` axis 2 — second interlocking principle)

**Canonical**: An interaction mode where AI challenges, generates counter-arguments, names uncertainty, and resists giving easy answers; load-bearing runtime mechanism per VISION axis 2 (not optional skill).

**What it is**: The second VISION axis. AI participates in sparring-mode interaction, distinct from oracle-mode (humans submit AI's answer as their own; performance same as AI alone) or validator-mode (humans ask AI to support preconceptions; sycophancy loop; performance worse than AI alone). Per Vivienne Ming's research, only sparring-mode produces value rivaling or beating prediction markets. Sparring keeps the practitioner critically engaged.

**What it is NOT**:
- Not optional skill called per-task (it's a load-bearing runtime PILLAR in practitioner-shape)
- Not antagonistic-AI for its own sake (sparring is in service of the practitioner-author's growing capacity, not for confrontation)
- Not sparring-always (oracle mode is right for fact lookup; sparring overhead misplaced for trivial questions)
- Not the same as "sparring mechanisms" (the mechanisms — counter-argument, confidence calibration, etc. — are framework-level capabilities; sparring is the MODE characterized by these mechanisms)

**Cross-archetype illustration**: legal practice sparring on legal arguments; research lab sparring on methodology + manuscript claims; planning bureau sparring on Begründung argumentation choices; auditor sparring on audit-finding interpretations — same axis applies wherever practitioner faces nontrivial judgment calls.

**Boundary test**: ask "does the AI challenge / generate counter-arguments / surface uncertainty, or deliver easy answers?" If easy-answers → answer-machine failure mode (axis 2 failure).

**Composes with**:
- 8 sparring sub-mechanisms (canonical entries forthcoming): `counter-argument`, `confidence calibration`, `visible reasoning`, `selective friction`, `asymmetric knowledge respect`, `anti-sycophancy`, `commit-to-recommendations`, `what's-missing`
- `sparring mechanisms` — class of axis-2 mechanisms (canonical entry forthcoming)

## specialist

- **Class**: PRIMITIVE (atomic; the bundled-expertise unit) — **bipartite** multi-aspect (DEFINITION in Framework C; INSTANCE-CONTENT in Owner B)
- **Layer**: multi-aspect (Framework C for the distributable definition; Owner B for entities owned by the deployed specialist instance)
- **Axis**: cross-axis (specialists support any axis through their bundled skills + entities + adapters)
- **VISION usage**: directly used (`VISION.md` thesis line 7: "codified expertise bundled as specialists")

**Canonical**: A composable bundle of codified expertise — skills + entities + memory + adapters — distributable as a unit. Bipartite multi-aspect primitive: a specialist's DEFINITION lives at Framework C scope (the distributable bundle); when a workspace activates a specialist, the entities owned by the specialist's instance live at Owner B scope. NOT a Pattern A primitive — a specialist has no multiple interchangeable implementations; it IS its definition.

**What it is**: The cohesion abstraction for codified expertise. A specialist packages everything needed to address a defined competence area into a single distributable unit. Workspaces activate specialists via `workspace.md`'s `specialists_active` field; an activated specialist runs within the workspace's substrate, contributing its skills + entities + memory to the workspace's work output. Specialists are designed to be reusable across workspaces (e.g., `citation-verification` works in legal, research, and planning workspaces); marketplace distribution (per archived ROADMAP v3) treats specialists as the canonical distributable unit.

**What it is NOT**:
- Not a Pattern A primitive — specialist has NO multiple interchangeable implementations (the `planning-document-work` specialist is one specific bundle, not interchangeable with another impl)
- Not a `workspace` — workspaces activate specialists; specialist is one of many elements a workspace activates
- Not a `skill` — skill is the atomic unit of work logic WITHIN a specialist; specialist is the bundle that contains skills
- Not a `practitioner` — practitioner is the human author; specialist is the codified expertise that the practitioner-led workspace deploys
- Not the `framework` — framework provides universal mechanisms; specialist is one Framework C definition among many primitive kinds

**Cross-archetype illustration** (named, archived examples):
- **planning-document-work** — domain-anchored specialist; PBS pioneer reference; bundles skills for B-Plan-Begründung drafting + review
- **citation-verification** — cross-archetype specialist; usable in legal practice (case-law citations), research lab (paper citations), planning bureau (legal-text citations)
- **project-management** — cross-archetype business specialist
- **invoicing** — cross-archetype business specialist (with adapter for accounting integration)
- **brand-voice** — cross-archetype creative specialist
- **legal-research** — legal-practice-anchored specialist

A workspace activates a domain-relevant set: PBS-Schulz might activate `planning-document-work + project-management + invoicing`; Müller Law workspace might activate `legal-research + citation-verification + project-management + invoicing`.

**Boundary test**: Three questions:
1. Is this a unit of work logic that fires on a trigger? → it's a `skill` — within a specialist
2. Is this a deployment scope? → it's a `workspace`
3. Is this codified expertise bundled as a distributable unit? → it's a specialist
4. Disambiguator: is this multiple interchangeable implementations of one Protocol surface? → it's a Pattern A primitive (substrate / adapter / protocol), NOT specialist

**Composes with**:
- `workspace` — workspace activates specialists per `specialists_active` field in `workspace.md`
- `Framework C scope` — specialist DEFINITIONS live here as distributable bundles
- `Owner B scope` — specialist INSTANCE-CONTENT (entities owned by the deployed specialist instance) lives here
- `skill` — skills are atomic work logic units within a specialist
- `mechanism` — specialists use framework mechanisms (audit emission, source-grounding, sparring) via the substrate at runtime
- `shape` — shape policies may mandate certain specialists or constrain what's permitted (e.g., practitioner-shape may mandate sparring-relevant specialists)
- `adapter` — specialists may bundle adapter implementations as part of their package (canonical entry forthcoming)

  - Line 11: "any practitioner workspace shape (legal practice, research lab, creative studio, etc.)" — implies specialists deploy to multiple shapes

## substrate

- **Class**: PRIMITIVE (atomic; the deployment-runtime unit) — **tri-aspect** (Protocol surface = mechanism; implementations = Framework C definitions; running instance = workspace-bound at Owner B)
- **Layer**: multi-aspect (framework-mechanism for the Protocol surface; Framework C for implementations; Owner B at workspace runtime)
- **Axis**: cross-axis (substrate hosts all axes' runtime behavior)
- **VISION usage**: implicit (VISION doesn't directly use "substrate"; concept lives in `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE + Framework C scope members)

**Canonical**: A deployment runtime that workspaces run on — defines the agent loop, tool/MCP-server registration, permission flow, hook events, and session/context primitives via a Protocol surface; concrete implementations (Claude Agent SDK, MS Agent Framework, future) live as Framework C definitions; a workspace selects exactly one substrate via its `workspace.md`.

**What it is**: One of the framework's mechanism categories (per `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE). The substrate provides the runtime contract any workspace operates on. The Protocol surface (interface contract) is universal/shape-neutral; specific implementations differ in how they realize that surface (e.g., Claude Agent SDK = Anthropic plugin runtime; MS Agent Framework = Microsoft agentic framework). **Substrate is an instance of the Protocol pattern** (per `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE "Recurring patterns: Protocol pluggability"): Substrate Protocol Surface (mechanism; framework-level) + concrete Implementations (Framework C definitions: Claude Agent SDK, MS AF, future) + a running Instance bound to each workspace deployment (Owner B; via `workspace.md` `substrate:` field). NOT the same as specialist's bipartite manifestation (specialist is definition+instance-content; no multiple implementations like substrate has).

**What it is NOT**:
- Not the `framework` itself — framework is the universal mechanism layer; substrate is one mechanism category within the framework
- Not a `shape` — shape is the policy bundle archetype; substrate is a runtime-contract mechanism that shapes specify compatibility with (not equivalent)
- Not a `workspace` — workspaces select a substrate via `workspace.md`; substrate is what they run ON
- Not the `codebase` — substrate is the architectural runtime contract + its implementations; the codebase realizes one substrate impl

**Cross-archetype illustration**: All shapes use SOME substrate; not all shapes are compatible with all substrates. Examples (named, factually existing):
- **Claude Agent SDK** — Anthropic's plugin/agent runtime; archived as primary substrate per session-12 substrate eval
- **MS Agent Framework** — Microsoft's agentic framework; archived as second backend
- (Future substrates may emerge — e.g., specialized runtimes for Tier-3 / federation / autonomous-business shapes)

A practitioner-shape PBS-Schulz workspace might run on Claude Agent SDK; a knowledge-graph-shape workspace might run on a different substrate optimized for retrieval; the SAME framework mechanisms (audit emission, source-grounding, etc.) compose with each.

**Boundary test**: ask "what's the runtime contract this workspace operates on?" → it's the substrate. Three disambiguators:
1. Is this a runtime-contract Protocol surface or implementation? → substrate (mechanism + Framework C definition)
2. Is this a configured value in a shape's bundle? → it's a `policy`, not substrate
3. Is this a workspace-instance-level binding? → it's workspace configuration (workspace selects which substrate)

**Composes with**:
- `framework` — substrate is one mechanism category within the framework
- `mechanism` — the substrate's Protocol surface IS a mechanism (framework-level interface contract)
- `Framework C scope` — substrate IMPLEMENTATIONS live here as distributable definitions
- `shape` — shapes declare compatibility with substrates (not all shapes work on all substrates)
- `workspace` — workspace selects exactly one substrate via `workspace.md`
- `Owner B scope` — running substrate instance is bound to workspace deployment (Owner B)
- `protocol` (architectural) — substrate Protocol surface is one of the framework's architectural Protocols (canonical entry forthcoming)

**Source**:
- `MAINTENANCE.md` "TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE" — substrate listed as Framework C definition member + framework-mechanism category
- `Framework C scope` GLOSSARY entry: "substrate definitions (runtime contracts: Claude Agent SDK, MS AF, future)"
- `workspace` GLOSSARY entry: "workspace runs on exactly one substrate"

## workspace

- **Class**: PRIMITIVE (atomic; the deployment-instance unit)
- **Layer**: cross-cutting (workspace integrates framework mechanisms + shape policies + practitioners; orthogonal to mechanism/policy split per `MAINTENANCE.md` TOP-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE)
- **Axis**: cross-axis (workspace is the container in which all three VISION axes manifest)
- **VISION usage**: directly used (`VISION.md` thesis line 7 + cross-archetype examples throughout)

**Canonical**: The deployment-instance container that integrates framework mechanisms + shape policies + active specialists + practitioners + state into a coherent unit for accountability-bearing work; selects exactly one shape via its `workspace.md`; lives at Owner B scope.

**What it is**: The top-level deployment primitive — what gets bound when a practitioner deploys PBS for their work. A workspace is the central Owner B instance: its `workspace.md` selects shape + substrate + active specialists; its workspace-scope managed entities (practitioner-record, Actor, Client) live at Owner B; its layered content (references, doctypes, bausteine per Layer A) varies by domain/state context (configured via workspace's `scope.{domains, states}`).

**What it is NOT**:
- Not the `framework` — framework is the universal mechanism layer (what's POSSIBLE); workspace is one deployment instance built from framework + shape policies
- Not a `shape` — shape is the policy-bundle archetype (definition; lives in Framework C); workspace is an instance that SELECTS exactly one shape
- Not a `specialist` — specialist is composable expertise; workspace ACTIVATES specialists from the list in `workspace.md`
- Not a `session` (canonical entry forthcoming) — sessions are bounded interaction units WITHIN a workspace
- Not a single application running on a server — deployment-shape-agnostic (could be local, cloud, hybrid); not synonymous with "office" (prior naming, demoted session 13; workspace is broader)

**Cross-archetype illustration**:
- Planning bureau: "PBS-Schulz workspace"
- Legal practice: "Müller Law workspace"
- Research lab: "Smith Lab workspace"
- Solo creative: "Anna's Writing workspace"
- Knowledge graph: "BNatSchG knowledge workspace"
- Federation node: "Federation X workspace"

All workspaces are built from the same framework; they differ in selected shape (which configures policies), active specialists, and Layer A content per their domain/state scope.

**Boundary test**: ask "what's the deployment scope of this work?" The answer names a workspace.
- If answer is "a single feature" → it's a skill or specialist, not a workspace
- If answer is "the open-source product" → it's the framework, not a workspace
- If answer is "a configuration archetype" → it's a shape, not a workspace
- If answer is "a particular bounded interaction" → it's a session, not a workspace

**Composes with**:
- `shape` — workspace selects exactly one shape via `workspace.md` (the shape's policy bundle configures workspace's behavior over framework mechanisms)
- `framework` — workspace inherits framework's mechanisms; the selected shape's policies determine which are active/mandatory and what defaults apply
- `Owner B scope` — workspace lives as the central instance + container for workspace-scope managed entities (practitioner-record, Actor, Client)
- `specialist` — workspace activates a list of specialists per `specialists_active` field in `workspace.md`
- `practitioner` — workspace serves practitioner(s); records at Owner B (canonical entry forthcoming; dual-aspect: human cross-cutting, record at Owner B)
- `substrate` — workspace runs on exactly one substrate (selected via `workspace.md` `substrate` field)
- `session` — interaction units occur within a workspace (canonical entry forthcoming)
- `Layer A scope` — workspace's `scope.{domains, states}` configuration determines which Layer A content (references, doctypes, bausteine) applies
