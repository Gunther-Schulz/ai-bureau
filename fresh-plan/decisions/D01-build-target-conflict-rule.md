# D1 — 2026-05-08 — Build target + conflict rule

**Decision**: Primary target = reusable thing (framework / OSS / product). PBS-Schulz planning office = first deployment / proving ground (secondary). When the two pull in different directions, **generality wins**: defer PBS-Schulz-specific features that don't generalize.

**Rationale**: The prior corpus oscillated between "PBS-Schulz daily use is the goal" and "framework is the goal." Without explicit primary/secondary + conflict rule, framing drift kept reintroducing premature deployment-specific detail at framework level. Locking primary = reusable + conflict rule = generality first prevents the drift.

**Supersedes**: `5-PIVOT-DECISION.md` (which had PBS-Schulz as primary and framework paused).

**Open tension flagged**: PBS-Schulz is a real running planning office; daily work cannot pause while the reusable thing is built. A rule for keeping daily work running on whatever-already-works during the rebuild is needed; deferred to a later decision (likely under working procedure).
