# D5 — 2026-05-08 — Framework-core identity layer (structural commitments)

**Decision**: The identity layer of framework-core (per D3 layer 1) contains three structural commitments. These are orthogonal facets — *what* the framework is, *how* it works, *what* it's for. Each fails the inclusion test if removed; together they distinguish the framework from (a) a vocabulary, (b) a generic SDK, (c) a generic meta-framework — without forcing substantive disciplinary content into core.

**I1 — WHAT: composition system.** The framework's job is composing extensions — shapes, substrates, adapters, specialists, disciplines — over a *workspace*. The framework is not an SDK, not a runtime, not a vocabulary; it is the meta-layer where these compose.

**Workspace** (organizing primitive at identity level): the bounded coordination context where one composition runs. Has an identity, a composition (which extensions are bound), a state (what accumulates within it), and a lifecycle. Two workspaces are independent compositions — they may share extensions but their compositions don't bleed. Workspace is NOT a folder, a manifest file, a session, or a deployment instance — those are implementations / runtime episodes / colloquial names. The workspace *kind* (contract, manifest schema, state shape, lifecycle) will be defined at layer 2.

**I2 — HOW: machine-checkable contracts on kinds.** Every kind defined in core carries a contract that the framework can validate. Conformance is structural, not prose-convention. An extension declaring itself as kind K is checkably K — the framework can verify the claim. This is what distinguishes framework-as-framework from framework-as-style-guide.

**I3 — FOR: accountability-bearing AI-human work.** The framework targets work where attribution, reasoning, and authorship matter. Its kinds (to be enumerated at layer 2) are designed around accountability semantics, not as afterthoughts. Use for non-accountability-bearing domains is possible but unprivileged.

**Note on consistency with D4**: I3 sounds substantive at first read but is *domain-structural*, not *disciplinary-substantive*. It says **which kinds the framework cares about** (accountability semantics), not **which disciplines a deployment must perform**. A deployment can use the framework for accountability-bearing work without committing to sparring, intertwining, or any particular axis. The kinds support accountability-bearing disciplines; they don't require any specific discipline.

**Rationale**: Three orthogonal facets emerged from running the inclusion test on the prior corpus's "axes." Each prior axis failed the test as identity (a plausible shape could opt out). What survived was thinner: structural claims about what the framework IS, HOW it works, WHAT it's for. I1/I2/I3 together carry just enough identity to make the framework a coherent thing while leaving substantive content to shapes per D4.

**Flagged for layer 2 (not identity)**:
- Cross-substrate portability (Pattern A's ≥2-impl prior discriminator) — likely a property of the substrate kind / contract.
- Workspace-as-kind (vs workspace-as-organizing-primitive in I1) — concrete contract belongs at layer 2.
- Human-in-the-loop — implied by I3 (accountability requires accountable actors), not its own identity claim.
