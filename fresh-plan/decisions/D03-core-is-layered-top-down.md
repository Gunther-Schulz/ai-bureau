# D3 — 2026-05-08 — Core is layered top-down

**Decision**: Within framework-core, the contents are layered top-down:
1. **Identity / structural commitments** (what makes the framework be itself).
2. **Kinds / contracts** (the schemas of what kinds of things plug in).
3. **Extension protocol** (the rules of conformance: how extensions declare themselves, how core validates conformance, how extensions compose, promotion / demotion rules).

Layer 1 constrains layer 2; layer 2 constrains layer 3. Enumeration proceeds top-down: identity locked first, then kinds, then extension protocol.

**Rationale**: Top-down respects dependency. A "kind" only makes sense in light of the framework's identity; an "extension protocol" only makes sense in light of which kinds exist. Bottom-up risks defining extension rules for kinds that turn out unnecessary, or kinds that don't actually serve identity.
